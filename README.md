# ViVa: Visualizing Variation in the Arabidopsis thaliana 1001 genomes project

This app provides an interface to examine the natural variation of specified genes of interest in the 1001 Genomes project dataset.

It is currently hosted at <http://bser2.bse.vt.edu:3838/ViVa/>. Email wrightrc(at)vt.edu if it is down or if you run into any issues. The application is also available as a docker container at <https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/wrightrc/viva/general>.

The application is further described in the following publication and if you use it please cite the below:
